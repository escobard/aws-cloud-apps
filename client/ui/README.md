# UI

A simple React User Interface(UI) to interact with Notes CRUD operations.

## Requirements

[Node.js v20+](https://nodejs.org/en/) is required.

A valid `.env` is required. Refer to `.env.example` for the environment variables that the application expects.

## Quickstart

With the following commands, you can quickly populate environment variables from `.env` within a bash terminal:

```
set -a && source .env && set +a
```

`npm start`

### Scripts
To run the UI with hot reload and real-time compilation on code updates, start the UI by running:

`npm run dev`
